Introduction
============

vesna-ci is a script for automated testing (continuous integration) of
firmware for VESNA (http://sensorlab.ijs.si/hardware.html).

At the moment it only checks whether code from open pull-requests for a
particular Github repository compiles without errors or warnings. Soon it
will also be able to check results of unit tests and perhaps do some more
extensive testing. It communicates with Github users through commit status
messages, which makes it similar to Travis.

It currently works by periodically polling the pull request queue at
Github, which means that response time might be an hour or so. Web hooks
mechanism for faster responses to new pull requests might be implemented
in the future.


Requirements
============

 - apt-get install git colorgcc aha

 - Properly installed summon-arm-toolchain
   (https://github.com/avian2/summon-arm-toolchain)

   (See instructions at http://sensorlab.github.com/vesna-manual)

 - Properly installed PyGithub
   (https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub)

 - Web server to serve build logs.


Installation
============

 - Clone vesna-ci git repository into a directory somewhere.

 - Put Github OAuth token into "ci-runner.token" file.
   (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-oauth-token-for-command-line-use)

 - Make a symbolic link from ~/.colorgccrc to colorgccrc file in vesna-ci
   directory.

 - Set up web server so that "vesna-ci/logs" is accessible over HTTP or
   HTTPS.

 - Check values in settings.py

 - Periodically run "ci-runner.py". For instance, run "crontab -e" and add
   the following lines:

       PYTHONPATH="/home/.../local/lib/python"
       13 * * * * python /home/.../vesna-ci/ci-runner.py
